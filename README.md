# Smart Meter Data to Optimize Combined Roof-Top Solar and Battery Systems Using a Stochastic Mixed Integer Programming Model

This repository contains the model from the paper titled "Smart Meter Data to Optimize Combined Roof-Top Solar and Battery Systems Using a Stochastic Mixed Integer Programming Model." Three models are included here: the base model, the stochastic model, and the model with electric vehicle consideration.
Although the code has been made open-source, it would be appreciated if acknowledgements were made to the author, Emon Chatterji.
